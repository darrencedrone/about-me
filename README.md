About Me\nMy name is Darren Cedrone. I am currently enrolled in Stack Educations coding bootcamp. I am excited to change to a more relevant career field and to continue to grow as a person.\For Fun\nMy biggest hobby is music. I play guitar, bass, and sing. I also write original songs and record them in my free time. As far as listening goes, I love all types of genres and am constantly rotating my music. I am always willing to talk about favorite artists/bands and upcoming concerts. For non-musical hobbies, I like soccer and working out. I also play video games, though I am focusing less on them as they are a distraction from schoolwork.
